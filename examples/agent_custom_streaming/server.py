"""Example LangChain server that shows how to customize streaming for an agent.

Example uses a RunnableLambda that:

1) Uses the agent's astream events method to create a custom streaming API endpoint.
2) Instantiates an agent with custom tools (based on the user request).

In this example, we kept things simple and are outputting strings to the client
with all the intermediate steps of the agent. This is just for demonstration
purposes, and usually you would want to return more structured output in the form
of a dictionary.

To add history to the agent you can use RunnableWithHistory. Please see the
other examples in LangServe for how to use RunnableWithHistory to store history
on the server side.

Alternatively, you can keep track of history on the client side and send it to the
server with each request. For that to work, you will definitely want to modify the
streaming output to yield dictionaries with structured output, so it's easy
to determine what the final agent output was on the client side.

Customize the streaming output to your use case!

Note that we configure the agent using the `tools` field in the input rather
than using configurable fields. Using custom runnables and configurable fields
is another option to customize the agent. 

Please see configurable_agent_executor: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langserve/blob/main/examples/configurable_agent_executor/server.py
for an example that uses a custom runnable with configurable fields.

Relevant LangChain documentation:

* Creating a custom agent: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent
* Streaming with agents: https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/streaming#custom-streaming-with-events
* General streaming documentation: https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/streaming
* Message History: https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history

**ATTENTION**
1. This example does not truncate message history, so it will crash if you
   send too many messages (exceed token length).
2. The playground at the moment does not render agent output well! If you want to
   use the playground you need to customize it's output server side using astream
   events by wrapping it within another runnable.
3. See the client notebook to see how .stream() behaves!
